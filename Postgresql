Comparison operators

Operator                Description                                                                                                                    Example
   =             Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.                                      (a = b) is not true.

   >             Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.             (a > b) is not true.
   <             Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.                (a < b) is true.
   >=            Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. (a >= b) is not true.
   <=            Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.    (a <= b) is true.

Logical operators

Operator                                 Description                                                                                                     Example
   &              Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.                                                 (A & B) will give 12 which is 0000 1100
   |              Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.                                                               (A | B) will give 61 which is 0011 1101
   ~              Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.                                               (~A ) will give -61 which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number.
   <<             Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.        A << 2 will give 240 which is 1111 0000
   >>             Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.      A >> 2 will give 15 which is 0000 1111

Bitwise operators

EXPRESSIONS

There are several built-in functions like avg(), sum(), count() to perform what is known as aggregate data calculations against a table or a specific table column.
SELECT column1, column2, columnN
FROM table_name
WHERE [CONDITION | EXPRESSION];

SELECT column1, column2, columnN
FROM table_name
WHERE SINGLE VALUE MATCHTING EXPRESSION;

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE SALARY = 10000;

SELECT numerical_expression as  OPERATION_NAME
[FROM table_name WHERE CONDITION] ;

SELECT (15 + 6) AS ADDITION ;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS "RECORDS" FROM COMPANY;

Date Expressions

SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

WHERE Clause

SELECT column1, column2, columnN
FROM table_name
WHERE [search_condition]

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE >= 25 AND SALARY >= 65000;

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE >= 25 OR SALARY >= 65000;

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE IS NOT NULL;

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE NAME LIKE 'Pa%';

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE IN ( 25, 27 );

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE NOT IN ( 25, 27 );

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE BETWEEN 25 AND 27;

SELECT AGE FROM COMPANY
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT AGE FROM COMPANY WHERE SALARY > 65000);

SELECT * FROM COMPANY
WHERE AGE > (SELECT AGE FROM COMPANY WHERE SALARY > 65000);

AND OPERATORS

SELECT column1, column2, columnN
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition1] AND [condition2]...AND [conditionN];

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE >= 25 AND SALARY >= 65000;

OR OPERATORS
SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE >= 25 OR SALARY >= 65000;

UPDATE
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2...., columnN = valueN
WHERE [condition];

UPDATE COMPANY SET SALARY = 15000 WHERE ID = 3;

UPDATE COMPANY SET ADDRESS = 'Texas', SALARY=20000;

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE [condition];

DELETE FROM COMPANY WHERE ID = 2;

TO DELETE ALL FROM TABLE
DELETE FROM COMPANY;


LIKE OPERATORS

There are two wildcards used in conjunction with the LIKE operator −

The percent sign (%)
The underscore (_)

SYNTAX
SELECT FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE 'XXXX%'
or
SELECT FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE '%XXXX%'
or
SELECT FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE 'XXXX_'
or
SELECT FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE '_XXXX'
or
SELECT FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE '_XXXX_'


1	
WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '200%'
Finds any values that start with 200

2	
WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '%200%'
Finds any values that have 200 in any position

3	
WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '_00%'
Finds any values that have 00 in the second and third positions

4	
WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '2_%_%'

LIMIT OPERATORS
SELECT column1, column2, columnN
FROM table_name
LIMIT [no of rows]

SELECT * FROM COMPANY LIMIT 4;
SELECT * FROM COMPANY LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2;
OFFSET 2 will skip the 1st and 2nd Data and will show from 3rd.


SELECT column-list
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
[ORDER BY column1, column2, .. columnN] [ASC | DESC];


SELECT * FROM COMPANY ORDER BY AGE ASC;

SELECT * FROM COMPANY ORDER BY NAME, SALARY ASC;

SELECT * FROM COMPANY ORDER BY NAME DESC;

INSERT INTO COMPANY VALUES (9, 'James', 44, 'Norway', 5000.00);
INSERT INTO COMPANY VALUES (10, 'James', 45, 'Texas', 5000.00);

HAVING CLAUSE

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1, table2
WHERE [ conditions ]
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING [ conditions ]
ORDER BY column1, column2

SELECT NAME FROM COMPANY GROUP BY name HAVING count(name) > 1;

DISTINCT KEYWORD
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2,.....columnN
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition]

SELECT DISTINCT name FROM COMPANY;

JOINS IN POSTGRES
Join Types in PostgreSQL are −

The CROSS JOIN
The INNER JOIN
The LEFT OUTER JOIN
The RIGHT OUTER JOIN
The FULL OUTER JOIN

SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_filed = table2.common_field;

SELECT EMP_ID, NAME, DEPT FROM COMPANY LEFT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENT
ON COMPANY.ID = DEPARTMENT.EMP_ID;
   
SELECT EMP_ID, NAME, DEPT FROM COMPANY RIGHT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENT
ON COMPANY.ID = DEPARTMENT.EMP_ID;
 
SELECT EMP_ID, NAME, DEPT FROM COMPANY FULL OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENT
ON COMPANY.ID = DEPARTMENT.EMP_ID;
   

UNION
To use UNION, each SELECT must have the same number of columns selected,
the same number of column expressions, the same data type, and have 
them in the same order but they do not have to be the same length.


SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]

UNION

SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]


The UNION ALL Clause
The UNION ALL operator is used to combine the results of two SELECT statements
including duplicate rows. The same rules that apply to UNION apply to the 
UNION ALL operator as well.

Syntax
The basic syntax of UNION ALL is as follows −

SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]

UNION ALL

SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]


NULL VALUES
The PostgreSQL NULL is the term used to represent a missing value. A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank.
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. It is very important to understand 
that a NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces.

CREATE TABLE COMPANY(
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
   NAME           TEXT    NOT NULL,
   AGE            INT     NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS        CHAR(50),
   SALARY         REAL
);

SELECT  ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, SALARY
   FROM COMPANY
   WHERE SALARY IS NOT NULL;
 
SELECT  ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, SALARY
    FROM COMPANY
    WHERE SALARY IS NULL;

ALIAS 
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition];

SELECT C.ID, C.NAME, C.AGE, D.DEPT
   FROM COMPANY AS C, DEPARTMENT AS D
   WHERE  C.ID = D.EMP_ID;
  

ALTER COMMAND

The basic syntax of ALTER TABLE to add a new column in an existing table is as follows −

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
The basic syntax of ALTER TABLE to DROP COLUMN in an existing table is as follows −

ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
The basic syntax of ALTER TABLE to change the DATA TYPE of a column in a table is as follows −

ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name TYPE datatype;
The basic syntax of ALTER TABLE to add a NOT NULL constraint to a column in a table is as follows −

ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name datatype NOT NULL;
The basic syntax of ALTER TABLE to ADD UNIQUE CONSTRAINT to a table is as follows −

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT MyUniqueConstraint UNIQUE(column1, column2...);
The basic syntax of ALTER TABLE to ADD CHECK CONSTRAINT to a table is as follows −

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT MyUniqueConstraint CHECK (CONDITION);
The basic syntax of ALTER TABLE to ADD PRIMARY KEY constraint to a table is as follows −

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT MyPrimaryKey PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2...);
The basic syntax of ALTER TABLE to DROP CONSTRAINT from a table is as follows −

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP CONSTRAINT MyUniqueConstraint;
If you are using MySQL, the code is as follows −

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP INDEX MyUniqueConstraint;

TRUNCATE

The basic syntax of TRUNCATE TABLE is as follows −

TRUNCATE TABLE  table_name;


VIEWS IN POSTGRES

CREATE [TEMP | TEMPORARY] VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2.....
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition];

CREATE VIEW COMPANY_VIEW AS
SELECT ID, NAME, AGE
FROM  COMPANY;

Dropping Views
To drop a view, simply use the DROP VIEW statement with the view_name. The basic DROP VIEW syntax is as follows −

testdb=# DROP VIEW view_name;
The following command will delete COMPANY_VIEW view, which we created in the last section −

testdb=# DROP VIEW COMPANY_VIEW;


CONSTRAINTS
The following are commonly used constraints available in PostgreSQL.

NOT NULL Constraint − Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.

CREATE TABLE COMPANY1(
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
   NAME           TEXT    NOT NULL,
   AGE            INT     NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS        CHAR(50),
   SALARY         REAL
);

UNIQUE Constraint − Ensures that all values in a column are different.

CREATE TABLE COMPANY3(
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
   NAME           TEXT    NOT NULL,
   AGE            INT     NOT NULL UNIQUE,
   ADDRESS        CHAR(50),
   SALARY         REAL    DEFAULT 50000.00
);

PRIMARY Key − Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.

CREATE TABLE COMPANY4(
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
   NAME           TEXT    NOT NULL,
   AGE            INT     NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS        CHAR(50),
   SALARY         REAL
);

FOREIGN Key − Constrains data based on columns in other tables.
CREATE TABLE COMPANY6(
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
   NAME           TEXT    NOT NULL,
   AGE            INT     NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS        CHAR(50),
   SALARY         REAL
);

CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT1(
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY      NOT NULL,
   DEPT           CHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   EMP_ID         INT      references COMPANY6(ID)
);

CHECK Constraint − The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.
CREATE TABLE COMPANY5(
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
   NAME           TEXT    NOT NULL,
   AGE            INT     NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS        CHAR(50),
   SALARY         REAL    CHECK(SALARY > 0)
);


EXCLUSION Constraint − The EXCLUDE constraint ensures that if any two rows are compared on the specified column(s) 
or expression(s) using the specified operator(s), not all of these comparisons will return TRUE.

CREATE TABLE COMPANY7(
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
   NAME           TEXT,
   AGE            INT  ,
   ADDRESS        CHAR(50),
   SALARY         REAL,
   EXCLUDE USING gist
   (NAME WITH =,
   AGE WITH <>)
);

Here, USING gist is the type of index to build and use for enforcement.

As we have enforced the age has to be same, let us see this by inserting records to the table −
INSERT INTO COMPANY7 VALUES(1, 'Paul', 32, 'California', 20000.00 );
INSERT INTO COMPANY7 VALUES(2, 'Paul', 32, 'Texas', 20000.00 );
INSERT INTO COMPANY7 VALUES(3, 'Paul', 42, 'California', 20000.00 );

For the first two INSERT statements, the records are added to the COMPANY7 table. For the third INSERT statement, 
the following error is displayed −
ERROR:  conflicting key value violates exclusion constraint "company7_name_age_excl"
DETAIL:  Key (name, age)=(Paul, 42) conflicts with existing key (name, age)=(Paul, 32).

Dropping Constraints
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT some_name;
